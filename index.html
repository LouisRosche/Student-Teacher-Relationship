            <h2>Why This Matters to YOU</h2>
            <p>Research tracking over 2.6 million students across 70+ years shows that students who have positive relationships with their teachers are significantly more engaged in learning and achieve better grades. The effect is so strong that researchers measured it at 0.72 on the effect size scale—that's considered highly significant. Translation: <strong>How you interact with your teachers directly impacts your learning and grades.</strong></p>
